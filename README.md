# How to use

- Import mockData.postman_collection.json to your postman
- Run the app
- Use Test folder to run a complete test (Send all needed results & the command needed)
- Use Command folder to send only a specific command
- Use Result folder to send only a specific result

#### NOTE:
    If sending a command or result, pay attention to the id sent in the url! Should be the same as the other events.
    Otherwise, your application won't aggregate the events!
